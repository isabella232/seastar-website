While many applications can benefit from high performance, Seastar is currently focused on high-throughput, low-latency I/O intensive applications.

* [Pedis](https://github.com/fastio/pedis): Redis-compatible data structure store
* [Scylla](http://www.scylladb.com/): NoSQL column-store database, compatible with Apache Cassandra at 10x the throughput
* Seastar HTTPD: web server
* [Seastar Memcached](https://github.com/scylladb/seastar/wiki/Running-Seastar-Memcached): a fast server for the Memcache key-value store
